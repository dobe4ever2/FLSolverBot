# Project
Repo: https://github.com/dobe4ever/FLSolverBot
Development: Codespaces (vs code browser)
Deployment: Railway

# Overview
The bot is a Fantasyland Poker solver that supports all variants (14–17 cards). It processes screenshots from any poker app where the hero is in Fantasyland mode. The image is analyzed using a vision-language model to extract the visible cards from the image, which are then passed to the solver function for optimal hand arrangement.

**Flow:**
Screenshot → Telegram API (image) → Base64 → Vision model (cards → text) → Solver → Formatted solution → Telegram API (send reply)
